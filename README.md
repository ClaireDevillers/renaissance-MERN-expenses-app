## How to run code locally

To run the code locally you can to:
1. clone the repository. 
2. You must have .env file with DB_URL pointing a mongoDB database. Please ask me if you need this.
3. Do `npm install` to install all the node module
4. Do `npm run build` to generate the build folder
5. Then do `nodemon server.js` to run the nodeJS server backend.
6. Finally, do `npm start` to run the React frontend in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
